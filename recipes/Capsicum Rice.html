    <h1>Capsicum Rice</h1>

    <p> 
        For those who like Capsicum or Bell Pepper, here’s an aromatic and flavorful pulao 
        made with green bell peppers, spices and rice. This is a mildly spiced and light pulao 
        and thus goes well with kids or folks who do not prefer spicy food. It can also be 
        packed in the tiffin box with a side of dal or a gravy dish or chutney.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are not many ingredients used in the recipe and thus this capsicum rice pairs 
        nicely with a side of a vegetable or paneer curry, lentils or even a simple onion-tomato 
        raita. If you like you can make this capsicum spicy by adding ginger-garlic paste, green 
        chillies and red chilli powder.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Capsicums</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
        <li>2 cloves</li>
        <li>1 inch cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 small tej patta (or 1 medium to large tej patta)</li>
        <li>2 single strands of mace</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 1 cup basmati rice very well in water. 
            Then soak rice in water for 20 to 30 minutes. 
            Later drain all the water and keep the rice aside.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile when the rice is soaking, slice 1 medium 
            onion thinly (about ½ cup thinly sliced onions). 
            Also slice 2 medium-sized capsicums or green bell peppers 
            (about ¾ to 1 cup sliced capsicum). Set the sliced veggies aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Add the whole spices listed below:
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
                <li>2 cloves</li>
                <li>1 inch cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 small tej patta (or 1 medium to large tej patta)</li>
                <li>2 single strands of mace</li>
            </ul>
            Fry on low heat for some seconds till the spices crackle and become fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the thinly sliced onions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix very well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté stirring often on medium-low heat till the onions become golden or caramelize. 
            Take care not to burn them. Onions take more time to caramelize. To make them cook 
            faster add a pinch of salt while caramelizing them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lower the heat and add the sliced capsicum.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir and mix to combine with the caramelized onions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté on a low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the soaked rice and salt as required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the rice grains gently with the rest of the ingredients. Sauté rice for a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 1.75 cups water. Also, squeeze in 4 to 5 drops of lemon juice. Stir again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pressure cooker with its lid and pressure cook capsicum rice on a medium to 
            medium-high heat for 2 to 3 whistles. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve capsicum rice garnished with some coriander leaves (cilantro) with a side of a 
            Vegetable Curry or Dal (Lentils) or Raita. Here I served the bell pepper rice with 
            mushroom masala.
        </li>
    </ol>
